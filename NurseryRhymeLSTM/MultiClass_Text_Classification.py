# Problem Definition
# For our problem definition, weâ€™ll try to solve the problem on the text classification 
# on BBC News articles and its category. Based on the given text as an input, we will 
# predict what would be the category. 
# We have five type of categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech.
